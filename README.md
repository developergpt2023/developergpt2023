# Hey there! 👋

I’m **Aaron** CEO and Founder of **Developer-GPT**, an AI-first builder based in **St. Louis, Missouri**.

I design and ship **GPT-powered products** and help founders turn ideas into scalable, high-performing web and app based solutions.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll scope it, build it, and ship it.
